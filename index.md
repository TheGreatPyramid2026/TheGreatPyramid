**$PYRAMID** is a speculative token with only one utility: to build the greatest pyramid ever. 

The Great Pyramid builders will accumulate $PYRAMID tokens just as they would stack blocks on a real pyramid. The more $PYRAMID they accumulate and the **longer** they hold, the **stronger** the pyramid will be. They will be rewarded generously with tokens normally reserved for the creator's allocation.

* **Dev Allocation:** Developers will keep only 10% of the total supply (instead of 49%).
* **The Rewards Pool:** The remaining 39% of the creator allocation will be used for weekly rewards distributed to $PYRAMID holders.
* **Rewards Distribution:** The amount of $PYRAMID distributed will be proportional to the relative size of each $PYRAMID position. Rewards will begin once Phase 1 of the token distribution is complete (250M tokens sold) to allow builders sufficient time to accumulate their $PYRAMID.
